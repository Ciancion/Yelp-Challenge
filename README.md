## day one
We grouped up, read the specifation of our task at hand. 
Initially we got an idea of how the app was going to be structured before spearatley spending an hour or so getting to grips with Ruby on Rails for the first time. After doing so, we grouped back up and began to set up the basic domain. We implemeted a few basic views, as well as some basic functionality that alowed us to add restuarants via a form. 
We had to restart a few times in order to make sure our URLs were RESTful, but in the end we managed to structure the project correctly.
